# TreeBeard 
To transform CSV or XLS Dataset on Tree View models.
Setting the top branchs with the most unique and important data and following down. 

(Still trying to understand how to pick the top branch) 
Will probly use SETs and DICTIONARYS to sort the data (could use PANDAS but i want to try a diferent way). 

The SCRIPT folder hold the file that will generate whe dictionays and generate a JSON exit file that will be displayed on Webpage powerred by DJANGO.
